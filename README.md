This is a simple list of domains that are blocked by my AdGuard Home installation. Any notes about it are surely welcome.

It is simply a combination of a huge amount of lists, but I filtered out the bad stuff and the things that prevent certain things from working on my network. Improvements will be added or removed from time to time.

I also use many lists that AdGuard themselves offer, which are more up to date than my list. I suggest that anyone using my list does the same. At least use one or two lists from more up-to-date sources to get the best experience, because domains change faster than I will ever be able to handle.

## How to Use This List

To use this list, you will need to import it into your AdGuard Home installation. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Open the AdGuard Home web interface.
2. Click on the "filter" tab.
3. Click on the "DNS Blocklist" option.
4. Select the "Add blocklist" file.
5. Click "Add custom list".
6. Paste the link that u are on when viewing the list as raw.

V1 (used generally)
```sh
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Werewolfke/AD-BlockList/main/BlockList/BlockList_V1.txt
```

V2 (used testing)
```sh
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Werewolfke/AD-BlockList/main/BlockList/Beta/BlockList_V2.txt
```

The list will now be imported into your AdGuard Home installation and will start blocking the domains that are listed.

<h3><span style="color:red;">&#x1f495;</span> Notes</h3>


* This list is not perfect and may block some domains that you do not want to block.
* This is not a NSFW filter, or does it try it to be.
* If you have any problems with this list, please feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository.
* Any domains u think are blocked without valid reason, open a issue with the domain(s) in question.
* V2 IS STILL UNDERGOING TESTING!!! (do not use on important networks it blocks more then it should for now.)

## Thank you for using these list!
