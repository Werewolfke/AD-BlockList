A Simplelist full of domains that are blocked by my Adguard Home installation.
Any notes about it is surely welcome.
Its simply a combination of a huge amount of lsit, but filtered the bad stuff out, and the thing out of it that prevent serten things from working on my netwerk.
Improvements will beadded or removed from time to time.

I also use many Lists that Adguard theirselves offer, that are more up to date then my list, i suggest for eanyone using my list to do the same.
Atleast use one or two lists from more up-date-friendly sources to get the best expeience because domains change faster then i will ever be able to handle.
